<h1>Genesis Administrators Guide</h1>

<p><font size="+1">Genesis was initially created as <i>ColdMUD</i> by Greg Hudson, and
was later engineered by other individuals, being finalized by Brandon Gillespie.</font>
<p>
<font size=+2 color=#6f0020><b>Introduction</b></font>

<p>Genesis consists of the programs <tt>coldcc</tt>, <tt>genesis</tt> and
<tt>control</tt>.  <tt>coldcc</tt> is used to compile/decompile the
database between textual and binary forms.  It is also used for
external binary database manupulation (such as adding objects,
fixing methods, etc).  <tt>genesis</tt> is the run-time interpreter of
a binary database.  <tt>control</tt> is not used at the moment.</p>

<p>Several variables are common to all programs:

<blockquote><dl>
<dt><p><font size=+1 color=#6f0020><b>Base Directory</b></font>
<dd><p>The base directory is where programs will start to look for files
    and other directories.  This is commonly named <tt>world</tt>, although
    it's name is irrelevant as long as the programs know what it is.  Unless
    you explicitly tell a program what the base directory is, it will assume
    the base directory is the current directory (i.e. the directory you
    are in when you execute the program).
<dt><p><font size=+1 color=#6f0020><b>Binary Database Directory</b></font>
<dd><p>The binary database directory is where the database files are located,
    do not specify a directory already used by other files as this directory!
    When the binary database is compiled <tt>coldcc</tt> will unlink and
    destroy any existing files, in an existing binary directory, or it will
    create it if it does not exist.  This entire directory is also copied
    when a backup is performed (with the ColdC function backup()).

    <p>If unspecified, the binary database directory will be <tt>binary</tt>
    in the base directory.

<dt><p><font size=+1 color=#6f0020><b>Logfile Directory</b></font>
<dd><p>If the program logs information, it will attempt to open it's logfile
    in the Logfile Directory.  If unspecifiedk, the logfile directory
    will be <tt>logs</tt> in the base directory.  The logfile directory
    will <i>not</i> be created if it does not exist.  When programs start
    logfiles are opened for appending, any log information will remain
    with the new log information appended to the end.

<dt><p><font size=+1 color=#6f0020><b>DB Root File Directory</b></font>
<dd><p>If the programs were compiled with RESTRICTIVE_FILES enabled, files
    may only be read and written to within the database root file directory.
    Unless otherwise specified this directory will be <tt>root</tt> in
    the base directory.

<dt><p><font size=+1 color=#6f0020><b>DB Executable Directory</b></font>
<dd><p>The database executable directory is for programs to be executed from
    ColdC with the <tt>execute()</tt> function.  Unless otherwise specified
    this directory will be <tt>dbbin</tt> in the base directory.

</blockquote></dl>

<p><font size=+2 color=#6f0020><b>Database Versions</b></font>

<p>It is important to remember that a binary database may <b>ONLY</b> be
   interpreted with the same executable that created it.  Because the
   byte codes can change from compile to compile (adding/removing modules
   can change these), the binary database will be different.  It is important
   to remember this when upgrading or adding/removing modules to a database.
   Always decompile a database to text <i>first</i>, then recompile the
   database with the new <tt>coldcc</tt>.

<p><font size=+2 color=#6f0020><b>Compiling/Decompiling a database</b></font>

<p>The simplest way to compile a text database is to enter the
   base directory and run <tt>coldcc</tt>, specifying the textdump to read.
   If the textdump is named <tt>textdump</tt> you do not need any
   additional arguments, as this is what <tt>coldcc</tt> expects.  Otherwise
   use the <tt>-t name</tt> flag (where <var>name</var> is the name of the
   textdump).  For instance, if your text database was <tt>minimal.db</tt>
   you would type:

<p><blockquote><pre>coldcc -t minimal.db</pre></blockquote>

<p>The simplest way to decompile a binary database is to enter
   the base directory and run <tt>coldcc</tt> with the argument flag
   <tt>-d</tt>.  It will decompile the binary database in the directory
   <tt>binary</tt>.  If you have a different binary directory name you
   can specify it with the flag <tt>-b name</tt>.  The text database
   will be named <tt>textdump</tt>, unless you use the flag <tt>-t name</tt>.

<p><font size=+2 color=#6f0020><b>Running the driver</b></font>

<p>The simplest way to run the driver on a binary database is to
   enter the base directory and run <tt>genesis</tt>.  <tt>genesis</tt>
   will automatically fork off and run in the background (if you do
   not want it to fork off, run it with the flag <tt>-f</tt>).  If the
   logfile directory exists logged information will be printed to the
   following files in the logfile directory:

<blockquote><pre>
db.log
driver.log
genesis.pid
</blockquote></pre>
<p><tt>db.log</tt> is the logfile for the database.  Information is written
   to this file with the ColdC function <tt>log()</tt>.  <tt>driver.log</tt>
   is used by the driver for messages which are not related to the run-time
   environment (such as reporting a signal).  <tt>genesis.pid</tt> contains
   the process id for the currently running driver.  This can be used to
   shutdown a server.

<p><font size=+2 color=#6f0020><b>Shutting down the server</b></font>

<p>The server can be shutdown two ways.  Either by calling the ColdC
function <tt>shutdown()</tt>, or by sending a signal to the driver process.

<p><font size=+2 color=#6f0020><b>Signals</b></font>

<p>Genesis catch and handle several signals.  Signals can be sent to a
   process in unix with the command <tt>kill</tt>.  When a signal is
   caught by <tt>genesis</tt> the method <tt>signal</tt> is called on
   the system object.  If a database wishes to perform an action when
   a signal is caught it may by hooking into this method.

   <p>The following signals are caught by <tt>genesis</tt>, handled as
   specified, then sent to the database by calling the <tt>signal</tt>
   method on the system object:
<blockquote><dl>
<dt>HUP
<dd>Sending this signal will flush all connection and file buffers, and will
push the interpreter into non-atomic mode, if it is running atomically.
<dt>FPE
<dd>FPE signal is converted to an ~fpe error for the task which caused it.
    No message is sent to the database for this signal.
<dt>USR1
<dd>This causes the driver to cancel all tasks (currently running,
    preempted <em>and</em> suspended) and return to execution as
    normal.  This is not normally suggested, as it can throw off
    a database's normal execution situation.  However, it is useful
    when a task has run out of control and is consuming resources.
<dt>USR2
<dd><tt>genesis</tt> does nothing with this signal.
<dt>KILL
<dd>If this signal is caught <tt>genesis</tt> will panic and shutdown.  No
    message is sent to the database for this signal.
<dt>CHLD
<dt>PIPE
<dd>These signals are used for internal processing, and are not sent to the
    database.
<dt>QUIT
<dd>The system will attempt to shutdown, currently running processes will
    continue to completion, and a message is sent to the database.
<dt>INT
<dt>TERM
<dd>The first time any of these signals are received all tasks are
    aborted (suspeded or otherwise), and the system attempts to shutdown.
    If these signals are received again the driver will panic.  No message
    is sent to the database for these signals.
</dl></blockquote>

To send a signal simply type:

<blockquote><pre>kill -SIGNAL `cat logs/genesis.pid`</pre></blockquote>

Where SIGNAL is one of the above signals, and assuming your log directory
is <tt>logs</tt> (this is the default value).

<p><font size=+2 color=#6f0020><b>Using a Binary Database</b></font>

<p>You will  want to be <em>VERY</em> careful not to run from a corrupt
binary database.  It is possible to work around the locks on a binary database
which tell genesis and coldcc its status.  Do not do this!  If genesis
reports the binary database as being corrupt, it is!  Many people have found
that genesis will run from a corrupt db, if you diddle with some files.
However, this is not a stable base to build upon, as the moment genesis
reaches corrupt data in the database everything will crash, possibly corrupting
even more data.  The suggested course of action when you have a corrupt binary
database is to simply run from a backup.  If you do not have a backup then
attempt to decompile the corrupt database with coldcc.

<p><font color=#6f0020><b>NFS</b></font>

<P>Running the binary database from an NFS disk is <i>NOT SUGGESTED</i>.
You will run into lag problems if you do this, even more notably when
a backup is running.  If possible some lag can be alleviated by soft
linking 'binary.bak' to a local drive, for backups (such as /tmp/binary.bak).
Overall this is simply not suggested.

<p><font size=+2 color=#6f0020><b>Backups</b></font>

<p>You can expect the backup to take approximately one second for every
megabyte in your binary database (it will be faster or slower depending upon
your computer and the speed of your disk).  Most of this is asyncrynous--
you are still running while it is backing up.  There will be a slight
pause of all tasks in the server when the backup is initialized.  The
length of this pause will depend upon how large your cache is, and how
many active objects are in memory.  In general this pause will be around
one second as the cache is cleaned.  It has been tested on a large cache
of 40x50 (2000 objects in cache) with many active objects.  The initial
pause takes about three seconds with this configuration.
