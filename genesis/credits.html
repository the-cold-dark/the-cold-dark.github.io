<h2>Genesis Credits</h2>

<p>Genesis is a derivitive work of ColdMUD.  The concise history of it,
from ColdMUD, can be found in the CHANGES file.  The name change is
to make a distinction between the developmental time Greg Hudson spent
(versions 0.0 through 0.10)--followed by various changes from a few
contributors, including Greg Hudson (versions 0.11 and 0.12)--and those
made under the management of the Cold Project.

<p>The Cold Project is a conglomeration of programmers dedicated to
advancing the driver and any relative databases.

<p>The Cold Project is a free softare organization.  If you enjoyed
software the project distributes and/or maintains, donations of any
type to continue their existance will be accepted.  Donations may be
made anonymously.  All donations are used to continue and extend the
Cold Project (The Cold Project maintains a server for development
and distribution.  Donations are regularly used in maintaining and
improving the server.  Hardware and monetary donations are both
encouraged).</p>

<hr size=1 noshade>
<h2>ColdMUD Credits</h2>

<p>This program borrows many ideas from LambdaMOO, written by Stephen
White and Pavel Curtis, and COOLMUD, written by Stephen White.

<p>The database routines in this code originate from code by Marcus J.
Ranum, although only the block allocation algorithm is currently similar
to his code.  The cache algorithm also uses his ideas.

<p>The regular expression matcher used by Coldmud (regexp.c) was written
by Henry Spencer.

<p>Numerous people have contributed valuble ideas and debugging effort.
Among them are Jay Carlson, Erik Ostrom, Matthew Rhoten, Loyd
Blankenship, Gregory Blake, Jeff Prothero, Nils McCarthy, Brandon
Gillespie, Ron Strait, Alex Stewart, Jordan Baker, Ryan Daum, Doug
Orleans, Matthew Gray, and Scott Dickenshied.</p>
